# Generating-and-Translating-Emojis-with-Generative-Adversarial-Networks

In this project we explore the exciting world of generative adversarial networks (GAN) by generating emojis using two different methods and GAN model architctures. 

In the first part, we implement a specific type of GAN designed to
process images, called a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN). We train the DCGAN to generate emojis from samples of random noise.

In the second part, we look at a more complex GAN
architecture called CycleGAN, which was designed for the task of image-to-image translation. We train the CycleGAN to convert between Apple-style and
Windows-style emojis.
